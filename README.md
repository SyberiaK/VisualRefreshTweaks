# How do I use this?

1. Install Vencord

   (if you have not installed it yet, get it [here](https://vencord.dev/download/))

2. Go to User Settings (click on the cog icon next to the chat field)

3. Open the 'Themes' tab

   Here you can either click 'Edit QuickCSS', and quickly enter it, or you can click 'Open Themes Folder' and put the CSS file there to always have it available.

## What has been edited?

- The typing indicator has been moved on top of the chat field:

- The window titlebar has been shrinked:

   And some more minor fixes, I.E re-adding "Today at" to the timestamp on messages, removing the pinned "Discover Guilds" button, etc...
