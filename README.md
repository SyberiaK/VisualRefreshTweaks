# How do I use this?

1. Install Vencord

   (if you have not installed it yet, get it [here](https://vencord.dev/download/))

2. Go to User Settings (click on the cog icon next to the chat field)

3. Open the 'Themes' tab

   Here you can either click 'Edit QuickCSS', and quickly enter it, or you can click 'Open Themes Folder' and put the CSS file there to always have it available.
